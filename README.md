## 🔭 Currently Working On
I am currently working on building and perfecting my backend framework, **Rensa**. Rensa is currently **v2.1**. Check out [Rensa](https://rensa.vercel.app) for yourself.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I am currently exploring Rust programming and building projects in Rust, and also building cross-language tools via Rust-Node bridges (eg, `napi-rs`), like my project [Decide](https://github.com/aether-flux/decide). I'm excited to dwelve even deeper so that I can build even crazier stuff with this new knowledge.
